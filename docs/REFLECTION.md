# Reflection

## Python

Python is a language I had dabbled in before, but had not used for a large open-source project. The project I worked on focused on the object-oriented paradigm, which I had previous experience with, using Java, C++, C#, Ruby, etc. 

Since it was my first time working on a Python project of this size, I decided to keep my features simple and easy to do. Much of the changes I contributed could be made by referencing existing code, using similar expressions. The language itself was not difficult, as it is basically executable pseudocode, according to [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/). Given enough time and exposure, I would be able to create more complex features.

## YAML

YAML is a simple functional language, which was easy and straightforward to learn. Much of the language revolves around defining key-value objects, which could then be parsed to execute some sort of behavior. Since I was using YAML for GitHub Actions workflow, there were predefined keys available to be used to define behavior (as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#understanding-the-workflow-file)), but not the specific implmentation. The functional paradigm allows the workflow file to remain relatively small, while being able to perform complex tasks without knowing the details of implementation (saves a lot of time).

It was not difficult to learn the language and find information on how to use it, as GitHub Actions had an official guide, and there were many tutorials available. Since I just needed to optimize and improve the existing workflow, I could do so by referencing the sections I already knew would work. This meant learning the syntax was as simple as going through existing code that previous developers have committed.

Much of the challenge I had was not in the language itself, but in implementing the feature I needed by hand. After many failed attempts, I ended up using an existing action in the workflow for the feature I needed. Defining a few lines of code was all I needed, without much worry about the implementation.
